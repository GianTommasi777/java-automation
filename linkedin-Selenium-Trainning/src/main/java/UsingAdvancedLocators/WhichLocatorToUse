Los mejores locators son:
- Unique
- Descriptive
- Static (Low probabilities to change)

Avoid this Locators:
- Link Text = Only works if the links are unique
- Tag Name = Ussually are not unique and descritive
- Xpath = It's not descriptive

Use this Locators:
- ID
- Class
- Name
- CSS Selector: This is the most powerful locator, can be used with
other types of locators. They can locate the most hard-to-find elements

Example
<input id="q" class="q" name="q">

By ID=
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector('#q'));

By Class=
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector('.q'));

By Name=
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[name='q']"));
