- Proxy server that routes commands to remote browser instances
- It spreads the load of testing across several machines
- Those Machines can run different browsers and browser version, and different platforms as well


How it works
One server acts as de Hub and routes json formatted test commands
to one or more registered grid nodes to access browser instances

A hub is a central point from where tests are executed.
A Hub also provides a list of servers that provide access to browser instances
or web server nodes

Nodes are where tests are run, each node is a machine that has their own individual
selenium instances.

Selenium Grid Allow running test in parallel on multiple machines and the ability
to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally
