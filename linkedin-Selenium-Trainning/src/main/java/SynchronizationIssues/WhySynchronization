Why synchronization problems occurs?
- Browser drivers operate at different speeds
- ChromeDriver and GeckoDriver are fastest

Where test are executed(Quantity of simultaneous test executed)
- local machine
- remote machine

Network speed
- make a difference in how test execute
- pages can be slow to render

identify synchronization issue
- Test gets stuck at a step
- "No such element Exception" fails test

Not found element issue
- The element could not be found by the locator specified at the time
of searching for it
- the element is not visible or present on the
page at the time of searching for it

Adding Awaits
- if the locator has ben correctly specified, the
solution is to a await
- Waits slow down the test, and search for the element specified
only after it becomes available

Types of Await
- Implicit
- Explicit
